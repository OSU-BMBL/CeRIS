		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q0" style="color:black;">What are regulons and CTS-Rs and why are they important?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>The term regulon was first introduced by Maas et al. in 1964, intended to name a maximal group of co-regulated genes, 
			which may be scattered in a genome without apparent patterns in terms of their genomic locations. Based on that, for the 
			first time, we define a CTS-R, cell-type-specific regulon, as a group of genes, receiving similar regulatory signals in a specific cell type, 
			hence tend to have similar expression patterns and share conserved motifs in this cell type. A successful elucidation of 
			CTS-Rs will substantially improve the identification of transcriptionally co-regulated gene modules, realistically 
			allowing reliable prediction of global transcription regulation networks encoded in a specific cell type. </p>

		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q1" style="color:black;">Why allow us to store your data?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Our long-term goal is to build a cell-type-specific regulon atlas for diverse cell types across different species 
			to uncover the heterogeneous regulatory mechanisms in different cell types. Your data could potentially help us set 
			up the database, and all contributions will be acknowledged in our future work.</p>

		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q2" style="color:black;">What is the hypergeometric test?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>The hypergeometric test uses the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the significance of having k successes from the annotated population</p>
			<br> <a href="./assets/img/tutorial/4.Q2.png"></a>
			<p>P-value of hypergeometric test is the probability of seeing at least x number of cells out of the total n cells in the list annotated 
			to a particular cell type, given the proportion of cells in the whole population that are annotated to that cell type. 
			The smaller of the p-value is, the more significant the cell type associated with the bicluster.</p>

	<div class="qa">
		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q3" style="color:black;">What are the evaluation indexes for predicted cell types?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>The rand index is a measure of similarity between two data clusters. The Rand Index (RI) is related to the accuracy and the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
			is the corrected-for-chance version of RI, and is more commonly used in assessing clustering results. The Full-text index in Minute space (FMI) is a compressed substring index 
			based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform, and the Jaccard Index (JI) meansers the similarity between finite sample sets. </p>

	<div class="qa">
		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q4" style="color:black;">How do DMINDA and MEME predict regulons?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>DMINDA: is an integrated web server for DNA motif 
			identification and analyses. The server provides a suite of cis-regulatory motif analysis functions on DNA 
			sequences, which are important to elucidation of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation: (i) de novo 
			motif finding for a given set of promoter sequences along with statistical scores for the predicted motifs 
			derived based on information extracted from a control set, (ii) scanning motif instances of a query motif in 
			provided genomic sequences, (iii) motif comparison and clustering of identified motifs, and (iv) co-occurrence 
			analyses of query motifs in given promoter sequences.</p>
			<br>
			<p>MEME suite: supports motif-based analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. 
			It provides motif discovery algorithms using both probabilistic and discrete models, which have complementary 
			strengths. It also allows the discovery of motifs with arbitrary insertions and deletions (GLAM2). In addition 
			to motif discovery, the MEME Suite provides tools for scanning sequences for matches to motifs (FIMO, MAST 
			and GLAM2Scan), scanning for clusters of motifs (MCAST), comparing motifs to known motifs (Tomtom), finding 
			preferred spacings between motifs (SpaMo), predicting the biological roles of motifs (GOMo), measuring the 
			positional enrichment of sequences for known motifs (CentriMo), and analyzing ChIP-seq and other large datasets (MEME-ChIP).</p>

	<div class="qa">
		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q5" style="color:black;">Why not using the TF name to represent the regulon or motif name?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">

			<p>The query motif identified by IRIS3 or MEME may match to more than one target TFBS profiles in the 
			motif databases from TOMTOM (see the following figure). Hence, it is not feasible to name the predicted 
			motif or regulon by one TF name.</p>
			<p>Therefore, the motif may not be unique, and two or more share the similarity may exist in one CTS-R.</p>

	<div class="qa">
		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q6" style="color:black;">How does IRIS3 define and interpret regulon names?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>For each CTS-R, its name is defined by the cell type number and the assigned regulons. For example: </p>

	<div class="qa">
		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q7" style="color:black;">How does IRIS3 rank regulons?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Each regulon is a set of genes that correspond to the predicted motif based on the motif scanning and 
			prediction (see <a href="#Q4"><b>FAQ above</b></a>). A group of motifs predicted by DMINDA is then be clustered into subgroups composed 
			of similar motifs using the following algorithm, which is based on a maximum spanning tree (MST) representation 
			of the candidate motifs. In this way, it is possible that more than one motif with similarities are assigned to 
			one regulon and the genes are then the union of all motifs. A global P-value for the entire motif instances is 
			calculated during motif scanning by summing up the possibility of at least k instances denoted in the motif. The 
			most significant p-value is used as the CTS-R p-value. The system will then sort and name regulons based 
			on the p-values from low to high.</p>

	<div class="qa">
		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q8" style="color:black;">How does IRIS3 perform normalization for CTS-R heatmaps?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>To better illustrate the expression value of the gene sets, we applied a <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2122/v1"><b>log-normalization</b></a> for heatmap interpretation:</p>
			<img src="./assets/img/tutorial/4.Q8-1.png">
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Where, <b><i>VN<sub>i</sub></i></b> indicates the normalized value for gene <b><i>i</i></b>, <b><i>VE<sub>i</sub></i></b> 
			indicates the expression value of gene <b><i>i</i></b>, and <b><i>n</i></b> is the number of total cells. The heatmap 
			comparison of pre-normalized and normalized values are shown below.</p>

		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q11" style="color:black;">How is the performance of IRIS3?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>To evaluate the performance of IRIS3, we compared our regulons with the result predicted by the 
			<a href="https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC"><b>SCENIC pipeline</b></a>, using the example data. 
			Default parameters were used for both tools.</p>
			<img src="./assets/img/tutorial/4.Q10-1.png">
			<p>As a result, our test showed that: 
			<b>65.96% (279/423)</b> and 39.74% (184/463) regulons identified by IRIS3 and SCENIC, respectively, are significantly 
			enriched with at least one biological pathways among all the 293 pathways. Hence, IRIS3 has a much better 
			prediction performance than SCENIC, in terms of the precision and recall in the above pathway enrichment 
			analysis (with F-scores <b>0.636</b> vs. 0.547).</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that IRIS3 only spends <b>23 minutes</b> for identifying the 423 regulons, which is <b>31 times faster</b> than SCENIC (9.5 hours)</p>
			<p><b>Note:</b> The harmonic mean of precision and recall were calculated to represent the performance 
			of an algorithm on a given dataset and parameter setting, denoted as F-score:</p>

		<h3 class="question"><a id="Q16" style="color:black;">What are the future plans of IRIS3?</a></h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<ul>
			<li>Build up a database of CTS-R atlas in diverse cell types of human, mouse and extend to other species.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Integrate more sequence analysis, including quality control, alignment, mapping, and normalization in the 
			IRIS3 pipeline to generate the normalized expression data from FASTQ.</li>
			<br>
			<li>An in-development tool, BRIC (biclustering-based gene regulation and cell type prediction from single-cell 
			RNA-Seq data), will be used to replace QUBIC to predict cell types and CTS-Rs simultaneously. The BRIC is 
			integrated with (1) a left truncated mixture Gaussian model for the accurate quantification of the sample-specific 
			gene regulatory signals and (2) a dual-core algorithm for more precise biclusters identification.</li>
			<br>
			<li>A more powerful in-house deep learning pipeline, DESSO, will be added in IRIS3 as a replacement of DMINDA and 
			MEME to analyze cell-type-specific ChIP-Seq data (integrate the Cistrome database) in support of more accurate regulon 
			prediction. DESSO (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/09/16/417378.full.pdf"><b>bioRxiv version</b></a>) is currently 
			under review in Genome Research </li>
