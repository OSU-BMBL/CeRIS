			<p><b>1.</b> Upload your expression file by selecting or dragging the file from local to the decker box. 
			Example data can be chosen or downloaded from the drop-down list button.</p>
			<br>	
			<p><b>2.</b> Choose the species, single or dual. Note that, choose wrong species wil lead to low gene matching rate to the database and loss accuracy.
			<br>
			<p><b>3.</b> Find out more about the advanced options for IRIS3. </p>
			<br>
			<p><b>4.</b> Check the box if you allow us to permanently store your data for our future CTS-R atlas construction. (Default: unselected)</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>5.</b> An email is not required to submit the job; however, we strongly suggest you provide your email 
			in order to receive notice once the job is completed.</p>
						<br>
			<p><b>6.</b> To submit a job, you have to have at least expression file uploaded and species chosen.
			A confirmation page will pop up showing your JOBID which can be used to retrieve 
			your result on the main page. Your job will typically be done in less than 1 hour, depending on the scale of the 
			input expression data.</p>
			<p><b>Note:</b> If the user directly load the <b>example data</b> and leaving all settings as default, it will be directed to the example result page without waiting for the program running.</p> Users who download the example data and upload for a job run will be regarded as a new job submission.

			<p><b>7.</b> The "Example output" will show you the result page of the human embryonic stem cells dataset, without running the program. </p>

			<p> <a href="http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/iris3/tutorial.php#1basics&q=1"><b>Pre-processing</a></b></p>
			<br>
			<p><a href="http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/iris3/tutorial.php#1basics&q=2"><b>Biclustering parameters</a></b> control the output biclusters from QUBIC. </p>
			<p>&emsp;<b><i>Consistency level</i></b> of a bicluster is defined as the minimum ratio between the number of columns, under which the component 
			genes share the same regulatory signal, and the total number of columns in the bicluster. The default is 1.</p>
			<p>&emsp;<b><i>Max biclusters</i></b> control the maximum number of to-be-identified biclusters. A larger value of o may significantly increase 
			the running time and induce noise as more fragile biclusters generated. The default value is 100.</p>
			<p>&emsp;<b><i>Overlap level</i></b> controls the proportional level (from 0 to 1) of overlaps between the to-be-identified biclusters. 
			0 means no overlap and 1 means complete overlap. The default value is 0.5.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a href="http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/iris3/tutorial.php#1basics&q=3">The number of clusters (k) in SC3</a></b></p>
			<p>The backbone of SC3 includes a K-means algorithm for feature clustering. The value of k can greatly impact the cell type prediction result. The auto-estimation method was used in IRIS3 to infer k. However, it showed that the value could be over estimated (>20) for the data with more than thousands of cells. So that, users are suggested to provide a relatively reasonable and small k value for such data to have a better CTS-R result.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Users can provide a cell label file with a "cell names" column matching the names in the expression file (optional), 
			and the second column indicating the ground truth cell labels. Cell labels will be used in two ways: (i) assess the cell type
			prediction results from SC3, and (ii) assign CTS-Rs. If no cell label file is uploaded, the pipeline will 
			automatically use the predicted clusters from SC3 for the following regulon predictions. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Users can choose to use either the prediction cell cluster result from SC3 or the ground truth cell types uploaded above 
			for the following CTS-R prediction.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The "upload gene module" function allows users provide their own gene lists and get them analyzed by IRIS3. The uploaded file can includes single/multiple columns, and each column represents a gene module.</p>
			<br>
			<p>At last, users can choose to use either DMINDA or MEME to perform motif finding and comparison for the final CTS-R inferences. The upstream promoter region is open to users to deside the region for motif finding. The default value is 1000 bp. Wider range may cause require longer computational time.</p>
