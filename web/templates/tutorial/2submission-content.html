			<p><b>1.</b> Upload your expression file by selecting or dragging the file from local to the decker box. 
			An example data can be selected or downloaded from the drop-down list button. When the data is 
			successfully uploaded, you will be notified as shown below:</p>

			<p><b>2.</b> Check box if you allow us to store your data for our future CTS-regulon atlas construction. (Default: unselected)</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>3.</b> Enable the gene filtering function.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>4.</b> Find more about the advanced options for IRIS3. </p>
			<br>
			<p><b>5.</b> An email is not required to submit the job; however, we strongly suggest you provide your email 
			so that to receive notice once the job is completed.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>6.</b> Once the data has been selected and options have been determined, you can now click the “Submit” 
			button to run IRIS3. A confirmation page will pop up showing your JOBID which can be used to retrieve 
			your result on the main page. Your job will be done in less than 1 hour, depends on the scale of the 
			input expression data.</p>

			<p><b>Biclustering parameters</b> control the output biclusters from QUBIC. </p>
			<p>&emsp;<b><i>Consistency level</i></b> of a bicluster is defined as the minimum ratio between the number of columns, under which the component 
			genes share the same regulatory signal, and the total number of columns in the bicluster. The default is 1.</p>
			<p>&emsp;<b><i>Max biclusters</i></b> control the maximum number of to-be-identified biclusters. A larger number of o may sufficiently increase 
			the running time and induce noise as more fragile biclusters generated. The default value is 100.</p>
			<p>&emsp;<b><i>Overlap level</i></b> controls the level (from 0 to 1) of overlaps between the to-be-identified biclusters. 
			0 means no overlap and 1 means complete overlap. The default value is 0.5.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Users can provide a cell label file with a "cell names" column matches with the names in the expression file (optional), 
			and the second column indicating the ground truth cell labels. Cell labels will be used in two ways: (i) assess the cell-type
			prediction results from SC3, and (ii) assign cell-type-specific regulons. If no cell label file uploaded, the pipeline will 
			automatically use the predicted clusters from SC3 for the following regulon predictions. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Users could choose to use either the prediction cell cluster result from SC3 or the ground truth cell types uploaded above 
			for the following CTS-regulon prediction, using either our in-house DMINDA server or the MEME suite. </p>
